project1

        --Used BFS and DFS to find the possible way out in a maze with lays and escalators
        
        --Applied the object oriented design to find the best trade-off between memory and run-time
        
project2

        --Used polymorphism, inheritance and pure virtual function to write the program to help a mine-breaker find way out
        
        --Implemented four kinds of heaps, including binary heap, Poorman heap, sorted heap and pairing heaps
        
        --optimized the memory by storing pointers rather than object for large data structures
        
project3

        --Designed the program to facilitate the trading of the stock market and compute the statistics in each timestamps
        
        --Used various data structures such as priority-queue, hash-tables and balanced binary search tree
        
        --Optimized the code by using a max-heap and a min-heap to avoid traversing the data structure to get the median of the stock price
        
project4

        --Designed the program using branch and bound algorithms to solve the travelling salesman problem
        
        --Created a dense graph and generated the Minimum Spanning tree using Prim's Algorithm and traverse it to get the initial upper bound
        
        --Applied the 2-opt on the initial bound to get a better one
        
        --Designed the various lower bound and keep updating the braching criteria to optimize the code
